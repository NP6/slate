NP6 uses API keys to allow access to the API.

NP6 expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`X-Key : ABCDEFGHIJKLM123456789`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>ABCDEFGHIJKLM123456789</code> with your personal API key.
